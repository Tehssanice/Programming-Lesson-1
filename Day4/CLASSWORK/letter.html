         <p> <b><i>Dear Jason,</i></b></p>

         <p> I'm writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effecttive August 14, 2020
         </p>

         <p> I've recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September.
            I'm tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
         </p>

         <p> I've truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It's rare to find a
            customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positve,
            inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.
         </p>

         <p>I'm particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support
            has meant so much to me.</p>

         <p> Please let me know if ther's anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.</p>

         <p>Thanks, and best wishes,</p>
