        <p>
            I'm writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effecttive August 14, 2020
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I've recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September.
             I'm tendering my resignation now so that  I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            I've truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It's rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positve, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm particularly grateful for your guidance while I was  considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Please let me know if ther's anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Thanks, and best wishes,
        </p>
