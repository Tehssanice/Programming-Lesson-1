    Verse of the day

    4 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud 5 or rude.
    It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.

    38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love.
    Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor worries about
    tomorrow--not even
    the powers of hell can separate us from God's love.
